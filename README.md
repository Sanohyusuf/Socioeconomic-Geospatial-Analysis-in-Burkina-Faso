# Socioeconomic-Geospatial-Analysis-in-Burkina-Faso
This repository contains the code and final report for a geospatial socioeconomic analysis of Burkina Faso. 
The project examines layered vulnerabilities, including shock exposure, food insecurity, and access to WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) 
services, by leveraging nationally representative survey data. 
The goal is to identify and map spatial patterns of vulnerability across the country's regions.
